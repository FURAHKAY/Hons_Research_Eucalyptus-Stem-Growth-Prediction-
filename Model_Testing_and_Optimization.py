# Steps:

# Evaluation Metrics: Define and explain the metrics used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
# Hyperparameter Tuning: Describe how you optimized model parameters.
# Cross-Validation: Explain your approach to cross-validation.
# Model Comparison: Compare the performance of different models.
# Coding Tasks:

# Implement hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search, random search).
# Perform cross-validation.
# Compare models using evaluation metrics

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, cross_val_score

# Hyperparameter tuning

grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Cross-validation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(best_model, X, y, cv=5)
